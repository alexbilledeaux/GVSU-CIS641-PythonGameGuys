# GVSU-CIS641-PythonGameGuys

We are creating a single-player roguelike game. In it, the player will explore procedularly generated maps, seeking the exit while defeating enemies and acquiring items to increase their survivability. When the player reaches the exit, a new map will be generated, featuring stronger enemies and items based on how many maps they have completed in their current run. There will be three classes to choose from, multiple enemy types to defeat, and the game will continue until the player is defeated.

The roguelike tutorial we used can be found [here](http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/)

The cellular automata tutorial we used can be found [here](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/generate-random-cave-levels-using-cellular-automata--gamedev-9664)
